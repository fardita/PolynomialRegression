# Coronavirus influence on italy and greece daily arrivals using polynomial regression
The analyzed phenomenon pertains to the daily recorded landings in Italy and Greece. The objective is to analyze the trend of this migratory phenomenon and identify whether there has been a reduction/increase in this phenomenon due to COVID-19 (Dummy Variable), thereby understanding if COVID-19 has influenced the trend of daily landings in the two countries.
We will use, as an initial dataset, the dataset containing daily landings in Italy/Greece, the Temporal Variable Ti, and the Covid19 variable. This dataset was obtained by extracting data from .json and .csv files from the website https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean.
